# Roman Numerals Project
Application to transform roman numerals to integers.

### Project Objective
Write a Ruby module to operate on roman numerals. Let's keep it all Ruby for now (instead of Rails), and use Rspec for testing.

### Follow these steps to submit your code:

1. To start, [**fork** the repository](forking).
1. [**Clone**](ref-clone) the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**](ref-commit) changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**](ref-push)/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**](pull-request) on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
